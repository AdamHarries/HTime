# HTime
This library provides functionality similar to the GNU `time` command within plain haskell code. This is implemented using FFI bindings to a stripped down library-like version of the `time` utility. 

TODO:
 - Test, test, test!
 - Clean up & modernise C code
 - Add better functions for extracting timing data
 - Implement JSON serialisation for timing structures
 - Document Haskell interface/datastructures
